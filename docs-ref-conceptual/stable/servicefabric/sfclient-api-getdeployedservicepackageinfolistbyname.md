# Get Deployed Service Package Info List By Name
Gets the list of service packages deployed on a Service Fabric node matching exactly the specified name.

Returns the information about the service packages deployed on a Service Fabric node for the given application. These results are of service packages whose name match exactly the service package name specified as the parameter.

## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| GET | `/Nodes/{nodeName}/$/GetApplications/{applicationId}/$/GetServicePackages/{servicePackageName}?api-version=6.0&timeout={timeout}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`nodeName`](#nodename) | string | Yes | Path |
| [`applicationId`](#applicationid) | string | Yes | Path |
| [`servicePackageName`](#servicepackagename) | string | Yes | Path |
| [`api-version`](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [`timeout`](#timeout) | integer (int64) | No | Query |

____
### `nodeName`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The name of the node.

____
### `applicationId`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme.
Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "~" character.
For example, if the application name is "fabric:/myapp/app1", the application identity would be "myapp~app1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1" in previous versions.


____
### `servicePackageName`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The name of the service package.

____
### `api-version`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: `6.0` <br/>
<br/>
The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.


____
### `timeout`
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: `60` <br/>
__InclusiveMaximum__: `4294967295` <br/>
__InclusiveMinimum__: `1` <br/>
<br/>
The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

## Responses
